Opal is a free and open-source [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) application that can play relaxing music in the background.

## Building

### Windows

#### Installer

You can create an executable installer by running the `jpackage` Gradle task on a Windows host:
```shell
./gradlew jpackage
```
*Do note that you will need the [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) in order to create MSI packages.*

#### Portable image

You can create a portable image by running the `jpackageImage` Gradle task on a Windows host:
```shell
./gradlew jpackageImage
```

### Linux

#### rpm

You can create an RPM, by running the `jpackage` Gradle task on a Linux host:
```shell
./gradlew jpackage
```
*Do note that you will need the `rpm-build` package in order to create an RPM.*

#### AppImage

You can create an [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/) by executing the `AppImage` Gradle task on a Linux host:
```shell

```
*Do note that running this task will execute a shell script in order to download and run the [appimagetool](https://appimage.github.io/appimagetool/) in order to create the AppImage file.*
